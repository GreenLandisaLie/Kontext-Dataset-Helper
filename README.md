# Kontext-Dataset-Helper

Simple assistant tool that allows you to easily spot the difference between 2 images and remove unwanted differences by drawing masks.

The area drawn will be copied from one image and applied to the other.

Mostly meant for Kontext Dataset curation.

Run the executable (.exe) and you will be met with a set of instructions you must follow prior to using this program.

### Note: 
The UI was designed for and tested only with a 1080p display. I'm not sure how it scales at higher resolutions - but it should be fine. 

However - it won't fit the main interface at resolutions lower than 720p.
